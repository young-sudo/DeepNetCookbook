# Deep Neural Network Cookbook

*by Younginn Park*

Repository contains solutions for some selected Deep Neural Network architecture tasks using **PyTorch** and optimized for running in the Google Colab environment. The implemented solutions were a part of the Deep Neural Network course at the University of Warsaw 2024/25.

Projects include:
1. Proximal Backpropagation (ProxyProp)
2. Adversarial Training (AdvProp)
3. Differential Attention
4. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Random Network Distillation (RND)
